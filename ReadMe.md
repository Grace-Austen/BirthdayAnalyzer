# Birthday Analyzer

Hi, this project focuses on creating a website that intakes a birthday and uses js API's to present the user with different information about things that happened on their birthday. These include: 
 - Horoscope
 - NASA's picture of the day
 - Movies that came out the year you were born
 - Holidays on your birthday
 - Famous birthdays
 - Famous deaths
 - Florida Man results

We used the following API's to meet our goal:

 - [Mozilla Fetch API to access our other APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
 - [Aztro API for horoscope](https://rapidapi.com/sameer.kumar/api/aztro)
 - [NASA API for NASA picture of the day](https://api.nasa.gov/)
 - [The Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
 - [Abstract Holidays API](https://www.abstractapi.com/api/holidays-api)
 - [Wikimedia On This Day API for famous births and deaths](https://api.wikimedia.org/wiki/API_reference/Feed/On_this_day)
 - [Bing News Search API for Florida Man](https://rapidapi.com/microsoft-azure-org-microsoft-cognitive-services/api/bing-news-search1)

One additional feature we have is the ability to switch between lightmode and darkmode.
